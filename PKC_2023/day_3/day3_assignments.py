# Step 1: Check the type of variable
age = input("What is your age? ")
print(type(age))                                #  this is string type


# Step 2: Type casting
age = input("What is your age? ")
age = int(age)
print(type(age))                                #  this is integer type


# Assignment 2: When to use comments? Give 10 different examples

# Comments can be used to do the followings:

# 1. To explain the code
# 2. To make the code more readable
# 3. To prevent execution when testing code
# 4. To add a description to the code
# 5. To indicate a bug in the code
# 6. To add a feature later
# 7. To remove a feature
# 8. To document a function
# 9. To ignore a block of code
# 10. To add a TODO, i.e. a task that needs to be done later
